his dataset captures detailed information about Titanic passengers, including demographic data, ticket details, and survival outcomes. It consists of 891 entries and 12 columns: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and Embarked. These features provide a rich source of data for predictive modeling, especially for understanding factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

During preprocessing, missing values were a key focus. The Age column had several missing entries, which were handled using appropriate imputation techniques. The Embarked column had a few missing values that were addressed based on contextual data. The Cabin column, with a significant number of missing entries, required careful consideration and was either encoded for limited analysis or excluded depending on its relevance to the analysis. Duplicate entries and inconsistencies were also checked to ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into the data distribution and relationships between variables. Key trends, such as survival rates by passenger class, gender, and age group, were explored. For instance, survival appeared to correlate strongly with gender (Sex) and ticket class (Pclass), revealing socioeconomic disparities in survival rates. Visualizations and summary statistics were used to highlight these patterns, providing a clear picture of the dataset's structure and potential areas for further exploration.

The dataset has been fully cleaned, with all missing values handled and inconsistencies resolved, making it suitable for analysis or machine learning applications. This refined version is now ready for sharing and further use in predictive modeling, classification tasks, or educational purposes. The cleaned dataset preserves its integrity while being prepared for seamless integration into analysis workflows.
